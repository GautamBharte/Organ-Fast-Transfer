## Fast Organ Transfer

Lack of an efficiently centralized metadata to generate potential matches in real-time as well as transport issues and traffic congestions pose a major threat to successful transplantations in a diverse country like India. Efficient route tracking architectures coupled with proper statistical and data analysis systems can help generate a roughly accurate database with potential matches spontaneously to tackle these emergencies and thereby reduce fatalities.

The goal of the project is to locate cases of immediate transplantation due to accident or any other incident, search the database and find a match which is the closest donor.
